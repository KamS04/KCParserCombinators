# KCParserCombinators

Parser Combinator library written in C.
Loosely based on the parser combinator library written by [Francis Stokes (Low Byte Productions)](https://github.com/lowbyteproductions/Parser-Combinators-From-Scratch). But of course, this is written in C.

Current Version: 0.1.0-alpha

## Build Instructions

The best/only way to build this is using make. This project was written to be built with GCC. On windows it has been tested with mingw (64-bit). It has also been tested on Ubuntu using gcc version 4:9.3.0-1ubuntu2.

Step 1. run
> make setup

This will create the necessary directories for the build process.

Step 2. run
> make

By default a release and a debug build is created.

## File Naming Scheme

Builds are outputted to builds\\win for windows and builds\\linux for every other OS.
The file **libparselib.a** is the release build.
While **libdparselib.a** is a debug build, that contains debug symbols for GCC plus extra functionality for logging.
(See [log.h](/include/log.h) and [kc_config.h](/include/kc_config.h))
